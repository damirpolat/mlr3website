```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(mlr3website)
library(htmltools)
library(mlr3misc)
library(data.table)
requireNamespace("mlr3verse")

content = as.data.table(mlr3::mlr_tasks)[, .(key, task_type, nrow, ncol)]
setnames(content, c("Name", "Task Type", "# rows", "# cols"))

```

The mlr3 packages also ship with some data sets, readily usable as `r ref("Task")` objects.
The goal of these tasks is to quickly demonstrate the capabilities of the packages.

```{r}
table_responsive(content, escape = FALSE)
```
